# Jua Mining Game

A customizable mining game inspired by Stake.com. This game allows players to bet virtual currency on a grid-based game where they click to reveal safe tiles while avoiding hidden mines.

## Features

- Interactive mining grid with animated elements
- Customizable bet amounts and mine counts
- Real-time multiplier calculation
- Game history and stats tracking
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Dashboard with game statistics
- Sound effects for game actions (diamond discovery, bombs, and winning)

## How to Play

1. Select your bet amount and how many mines to place on the grid
2. Click "Start Game" to begin playing
3. Click tiles to reveal them - green tiles are safe, red tiles are mines
4. Cash out at any time to collect your winnings based on the current multiplier
5. The more tiles you successfully reveal, the higher your multiplier goes
6. Hit a mine and you lose your bet!
